# yahg
A pure javascript framework-in-progress to create and manipulate hexagonal grids using [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) concepts.

## using yahg
1. add a reference to graphTheory.js in the head.
1. Create an SVG element in an HTML document.
1. after the DOM is loaded, initialize new Grid, Layout, and SVGRenderer
1. use Grid.layout() and SVGRenderer.render() to display the grid

for now, refer to theorytest.js and graphTheory.html for examples
